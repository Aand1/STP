Problem:
    Some of the stretched ddec (original nocruise) profiles had several
    solutions, some with a oszillation in the acc-graph.
Example:
    (1) figure; wrapper7st_stretch(7, 0, 3.6, 1.2, 1, 1.2, 1, 1.5)
Solution:
    Test for each profile found, that a3 is either zero, or its sign has
    the opposite direction of dir.

Change in stretch7st.m
Problem:
    During stretching a double deceleration profile with cruising phase
    switched into one without.
    This case was not covered by the algorithm so far.
Example:
    (1) figure;wrapper7st_stretch(1.7,0, 0.315, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1.5)
    (2) ta = [ 0 0 0.1 1 1]; j = [ -1 1 0 -1 1];
        tb = [ sqrt(2)/2 sqrt(2)/2 1 sqrt(2)/2 sqrt(2)/2];
        figure; plotjTracks(tb,j, 0,1,0, true, 0,0,0,0);   
        figure; plotjTracks(ta,j, 0,1,0, true, 0,0,0,0);
Solution:
    In the case of stretching a double deceleration profile with a cruising
    phase, if the normal approach to solve it fails, we try again with the
    same kind of profile, but without a cruising phase.
    This is neither a satisfying nor complete solution and just a quick
    fix-up until we come up with something better.

Problem: 
    In the algorithm for determining the stetched profile type of canonical
    profile, in the TW profile the area under the wedge and the area under
    t(2) might be equal resulting in a fullstop profile which causes
    a problem.
Example:
    wrapper7st_stretch(6.24818754884600924270898758550174534320831298828125,0, 0.77777777777777779011358916250173933804035186767578125, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1)
Solution:
    Introduced an additional case differentiation.

Change in stetch7st.m und calc7st.m
Problem:
    Calculation of the area that can be cut out ni the first part of
    movement in a WT pofile was calculated wrong in the functions for
    determining the profile type.
Solution:
    Corrected way of calculation.
