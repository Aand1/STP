Smooth Trajectory Planning

This repository contains the source code to our 2008 IROS paper
"[On-line planning of time-optimal, jerk-limited trajectories](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4650924&tag=1)".


It provides second- and third-order online trajectory planning.
For a more robust and complete implementation, we however refer to [Refelxxes Motion libraries](http://reflexxes.ws).
